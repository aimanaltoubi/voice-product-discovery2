"""Text to speech: turn text into an mp3 audio file the browser plays.

Providers (env TTS_PROVIDER):
    edge    -> Microsoft Edge neural voices via `edge-tts` (default, keyless).
               Audio arrives as a stream of chunks ("fragments") which are
               written sequentially to one mp3.
    openai  -> OpenAI TTS (gpt-4o-mini-tts by default), needs OPENAI_API_KEY.

Returns the generated filename inside MEDIA_DIR; the API layer exposes it
as /media/<filename>. The spoken text is capped — the answerer already
targets ~40 words (~15 s), this is just a hard stop.
